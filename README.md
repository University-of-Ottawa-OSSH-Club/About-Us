About Us

                       **The University of Ottawa Open Source Software and Hardware Club**
                                      
   Established in 2021, we are a group of University of Ottawa students, faculty and alumni that are interested in open source software and hardware.  If you do not know what that means/those are, but you are open to learning, you are welcome too. :)
   
   Although we are not formally sanctioned by the University of Ottawa/Clubs Office and are not promoted by the University, recognized on their clubs page, or supported with any resources, we nonetheless *exist*.  Now you are aware our existence, and we appreciate your time and attention. 
   
   We are also female-founded, if that is of interest.
   
   We will be holding meetings! Once the frequency and dates are decided, those will be posted here.  
   
   Although we have been encouraged to use proprietary platforms to promote our club, we do not believe in this.  Please help to promote us using Github/Gitter, Mastodon, Diaspora, Friendica, IRC, Pleroma, Matrix - we support open standards, and the fediverse.  Honestly, we aren't interested in members that just use F***book.
   
   Cheers!
